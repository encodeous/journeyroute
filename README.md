## `What is JourneyRoute?`

JourneyRoute is a path-finding mod for Minecraft. With JourneyRoute, you will never get lost down a mineshaft! As you travel in a world, it will build a network of all the places you have been, and is able to generate routes between locations. *The more you explore, the better the network will become, thus the paths that JourneyRoute generate improve over time!*

## `Usage`

To use JourneyRoute, simply copy the jar file into the mods folder. Make sure the following requirements are also met:

### Requirements:
 - Fabric Mod Loader
 - Minecraft 1.18+
 - JourneyMap installed

## `Is JourneyRoute Unfair?`

JourneyRoute only generates routes based on blocks that you have traversed on, thus it is not able discover paths for you. *Think of JourneyRoute as an assistant that helps players remember where they've been.* Despite this, however, JourneyRoute may be considered unfair on some multiplayer servers, and thus should only be used if it is allowed by server rules.
